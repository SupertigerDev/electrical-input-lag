# Electrical Input Lag
Over the past 10+ years, minority of users have been experiencing strange behaviors with their devices, specifically with their gaming PCs, and consoles. This website provides all of the symptoms, failed solutions and fixes we have tried. This issue is getting more widely spread, hopefully we will all found a solution to this someday ðŸ˜­

# Symptoms

### Floaty/delayed mouse
Mouse feels floaty, on ice, does not feel linear, feels like you are drunk, and unable to aim at your targets.
**Example videos**: TODO

### Movement
When moving with your mouse or keyboard, it feels very stuttery, G-sync does not help.  
**Example videos**: TODO

### Refresh rate
Even with a high refresh rate 240hz monitor, Moving your mouse on desktop/in game does not feel smooth, it feels like an unstable 60fps. 60hz monitors feel much worse than what they should.

### Graphics look buggy/muddy
The visual quality of the monitor is not as good as it should be. The graphics look very dull, shimmering and distracting, more than usual. Antialiasing does not do anything on any game.  
**Example videos**: TODO

### In-game or desktop
The issue is present on the desktop (while less noticeable) and in-game. Dragging windows around feels very stuttery.
**Example videos**: TODO

### "They are just hardware/software issues" "Just buy a new GPU" "Enable xxx in settings"
No. We have spent so much money on buying the latest and greatest hardware with no fix. While these issues may sound like simple fixes, they are not. We have also tried pretty much EVERY regedit, NVIDIA control panel (and AMD) options, in which none of them worked.

### Some changes give temporary improvements.
Strangely, Some changes we make, whether in hardware or software, it gives temporary improvements. Things may be fixed for 30 mins to months depending on what we change. This signifies that this could be related to an electrical issue or some interference. Because of this strange behavior, most people think that we are lost, and its all in our head, but please trust us. This problem exists, and is very frustrating to deal with.
